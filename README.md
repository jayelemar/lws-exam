## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Outfit, a custom Google Font.

I only created the frontend sa im not familiar with PHP and laravel. i will the backend in NodeJs Express in coming days.
